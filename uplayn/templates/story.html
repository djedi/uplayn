    <h1>The Story of U Play'n</h1>
    <p>The goal of uplayn.com will be to allow groups of people that like to get
    together for sports have a place on the web to let the group know if they are in
    or out on a given day.</p>

    <p>I have wanted to create something like this for a long time. I found a group
    actually did create something like this at <a href="http://afultimate.com">AFUltimate.com</a>. This is a
    group of guys that get together 3 times per week to play Ultimate Frisbee. The
    sign up form was very helpful in determining if there were going to be enough
    guys show up to bother driving to the field.</p>

    <p>I've played Ultimate Frisbee with a few groups and basketball with a few groups.
    I thought it would be nice to create a website for these groups to have their
    own free page that is simple to use, easy to set up and free of charge.</p>

    <p>I've decided to open source this on github to give back to the open source
    community and help Django noobs have access to some code.</p>
