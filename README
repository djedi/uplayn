The goal of uplayn.com will be to allow groups of people that like to get
together for sports have a place on the web to let the group know if they are in
or out on a given day.

I have wanted to create something like this for a long time. I found a group
actually did create something like this at http://AFUltimate.com. This is a
group of guys that get together 3 times per week to play Ultimate Frisbee. The
sign up form was very helpful in determining if there were going to be enough
guys show up to bother driving to the field.

I've played Ultimate Frisbee with a few groups and basketball with a few groups.
I thought it would be nice to create a website for these groups to have their
own free page that is simple to use, easy to set up and free of charge.

I've decided to open source this on github to give back to the open source
community and help Django noobs have access to some code.

Right now, this is just an idea. There is still lots of work to do before even
thinking about pushing it to a live site.
